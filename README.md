# Marvin - Metrics Tracker

> What I cannot create, I do not understand. 
> â€” Richard Feynman

* Simple daemon built with Rust to track metrics.
* The goal is run application as a daemon and track specific metrics. 
* We also want to be able to send metrics to a server via a socket connection if option specified when starting the daemon.
* We would only send metrics to server if threasholds are met.
* Configuration and threasholds are specified in a config file.
* Initially only alerts would be sent, not every single measurement.

### Requirements
* [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/)
* [daemonize 0.4.1](https://crates.io/crates/daemonize)
* [systemstat 0.1.8](https://github.com/unrelentingtech/systemstat)
* [sysinfo 0.20.0](https://crates.io/crates/sysinfo)

### How to run
```sh
# Needs to be ran as root
> make build
> sudo make start-daemon
```

### How to find and kill the daemon
```sh
make kill-marvin
```

### Project Progress
- [x] Run application as a daemon
- [x] Monitor disk usage metric as a POC
- [x] Monitor memory usage metric as a POC
- [x] Save data on local file on disk
- [x] Create Makefile
- [x] Write tests
- [ ] Publish on github as open source
- [ ] Import config file from /etc/marvin as TOML format
- [ ] Create install/startup script

### Roadmap
- [ ] Add flags to control daemon
- [ ] Connect to socket server with address at config if flag specified at startup
- [ ] Send metrics to server if threasholds are met.
- [ ] Improve local file storage
